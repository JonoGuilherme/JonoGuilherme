👋 About Me

I am a Data Analyst transitioning into Data Science, with over 7 years of experience applying analytics, automation, and data-driven insights to solve complex business and operational problems, primarily within highly regulated industries such as insurance.

My work sits at the intersection of data analysis, statistical thinking, and business decision-making, with a growing focus on machine learning, advanced analytics, and cloud-based data solutions. I have hands-on experience transforming raw, large-scale datasets into structured models, KPIs, and analytical outputs that support performance optimisation, risk reduction, and strategic decision-making.

Currently based in Ireland, I am actively expanding my expertise in Data Science, Cloud Analytics, and ML deployment, building end-to-end projects that reflect real-world production challenges rather than academic-only use cases.
